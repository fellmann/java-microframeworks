# Java Microframeworks Demo

This repository demonstrates how a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) microservice that generates a customized zip file can be implemented faster and smaller using [express.js](https://expressjs.com), and how a similar speed-up can be achieved using a Java Microframework like [Spark](http://sparkjava.com).

For the Spark implementation, different bundling options are demonstrated:
- OpenJDK
- Jib
- Serverless / AWS Lambda
- GraalVM
- Native Image

Take a look at the corresponding run/build-scripts as a starting point.
